## New York Times Clone

- New York Times Clone allows you to read the latest news articles from websites such as BBC News, Hacker News, and The Verge and you also have the ability to save the news articles for a later date (up to a week).

- This is a Single Page Application built with React.js, styled-components, and react-router that queries the news API endpoint, to fetch the latest news from different online publications.

- It features dynamic routing using react-router and usage of query strings that allow users to share the currently viewed page with their friends.

- The application makes use of the local storage API to save the latest news for a week, in case the user doesn’t have time to read or wants to read the news article at a later time.

- It features styling with styled-components (CSS in JS solution), for preventing CSS bleeding and allowing the styles to be more modular and portable.

- It’s been developed using git along with Kanban methodology, to keep track of the features that need to be built and preventing development errors.
